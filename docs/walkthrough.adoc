[WARNING]
****
Make sure you commands in any shell prior to the demo from within the root of the git repo for this demo:

----
docker run -it -v ~/.kube:/home/jboss/.kube -v ~/.oh-my-zsh:/home/jboss/.oh-my-zsh -v $(pwd):/workspaces/argocd-demo -w workspaces/argocd-demo quay.io/mhildenb/argocd-demo-shell /bin/zsh
----

Setup your windows something like this:

== Intro to Coolstore 

In this section we introduce the coolstore in its initial architecture.  Some points to highlight:

* Nothing is serverless
* Kafka cluster is in its own separate namespace

Here are the steps you should follow

. Navigate to the Developer Perspective of the `argocd-demo-stage` project
. Click on the badge to open the coolstore website
. Purchase an item from the website
. Show that the purchase has been completed

== Intro to Git Repos

In this section we want to show that we have an application repo and a gitops repo

Explain that we are using OpenShift development environment to play around and we want to create a serverless service.  In this section we'll edit the service and show the build getting kicked off

. get the gitea host
+
----
GITEA_HOST=$(oc get route gitea -n argocd-demo-cicd -o=jsonpath='{.spec.host}')
----
+
. log into gitea
. edit the file at this address
+
----
echo "https://${GITEA_HOST}/gogs/coolstore/_edit/master/payment-service/src/main/java/com/redhat/cloudnative/PaymentResource.java"
----
+
. Change the output of the success and failure processing methods
+
image:edit-payment-gitea.png[]
+
. Add a commit message and checkin
. In the second console window, show the triggered code pipeline

[blue]#We will revisit this later, while it's building, let's show argo#

== Intro to Argo

In this section we show how Argo is actually behind the staging project

. In the other browser window, switch to the argocd namespace and select `Installed Operators`
** Show the ArgoCD custom resource to show how this ArgoCD instance was setp
. Log into  the ArgoCD console
** You can do this either by going to the `argocd` project and then to Topology View and clicking on the route badge OR
** You can get the url like this
+
----
ARGOCD_HOST=$(oc get route argocd-server -n argocd -o=jsonpath='{.spec.host}')
echo "https://${ARGOCD_HOST}/"
----
+
. Accept any self-signed certificate and then login using your OpenShift credentials
** Point out that it is easy to configure OAuth via the ArgoCD Operator
. Click into the `coolstore` ArgoCD application and notice that it is synched
. Match up the Topology view in the other window with the ArgoCD view of the project
. Show the ArgoCD application sync policy

=== Self Healing

. In the topology view, delete the coolstore ui
. In the ArgoCD console, refresh (if necessary) and notice that the coolstore ui reappears
. Go to the cart pod and edit the deployment
. Attempt to change the image and watch as the deployment changes

== Export Infra

In this section we'll return to our development project, add a knative eventing service, and demonstrate our serverless payment service working

. Navigate to the `argocd-demo-dev` project
** There should already be a version of the knative service there
. Next we need to wire the payment service to an event source, in our case the `orders` topic

=== Knative Eventing: Create Event Source ===

. From the topology view, go the the knative payment service
. From the payment service on the topology view, pull out blue arrow
. Select `Event Source` from end of arrow
. Fill in the following Kafka SOURCE:
+
image:kafka-source.png[]
image:kafka-source-2.png[]
+
. Show the service starting up from the topology view
. Refresh the order details page on coolstore.  Order should now be processed
. Create a knative event source

=== Test the knative service ===

. Setup watch for the two topics by First open a shell watch window to run the following command to see ORDERS coming in
+
----
oc exec -c kafka my-cluster-kafka-0 -n argocd-demo-support -- /opt/kafka/bin/kafka-console-consumer.sh --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --topic orders
----
+
. Show PAYMENTS with this command in another shell
+
----
oc exec -c kafka my-cluster-kafka-0 -n argocd-demo-support -- /opt/kafka/bin/kafka-console-consumer.sh --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --topic payments
----
+
. Post to kafka
+
----
echo '{"orderId": "12321","total": "232.23", "creditCard": {"number":"4232454678667866","expiration": "04/22","nameOnCard": "Jane G Doe"}, "billingAddress": "123 Anystreet, Pueblo, CO 32213", "name": "Jane Doe"}' | oc exec -i -c kafka my-cluster-kafka-0 -n argocd-demo-support -- /opt/kafka/bin/kafka-console-producer.sh --broker-list localhost:9092 --topic orders
----
+
[NOTE]
====
Instead of posting the order to kafka, instead, from the main shell, run the following command to call the service directly

----
KN_ROUTE=
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d @$DEMO_HOME/walkthrough-assets/order-payload.json $KN_ROUTE
----

====


== Try to deploy our new image with gitops

. Open the Payment Pipeline Run
. Get the image tag/build number
. Create a new Pipeline Run of the Promote to Staging
. Show the different aspects of the pipeline
. Whilst building go to argo and Topology view split screen
** Change argoCD to main application page to wait for preview branch app
. When the ArgoCD app appears, switch to the corresponding Topology View for the `preview-` project
. Once the project deploys, show that it doesn't work (order won't get processed b/c the image no longer listens on order)
. Delete the ArgoCD app
. Switch back to gitea
. Go to the main of the gitops repo and show the pull-request
. Point out the problem with it
. Reject the pull request (but don't delete the branch until the application destruction is complete)

== Update knative infra ==

. Show the Developer Perspective of `argocd-demo-dev`
. Expand the blue shell by double-clicking on its tab bar
. Run the following command in the shell to show knative service export
+
----
kn service export payment -n argocd-demo-dev -o yaml 
----
+
. Run the following command to export the knative event source
+
----
oc get kafkasource kafka-source-orders --export -o yaml -n argocd-demo-dev
----
+
. Log into the in-cluster gogs repo
+
[NOTE]
====
If you were going to edit the scripts in realtime, you'd need to export each of the above and edit the output of both scripts to remove runtime information (managed fields, metadata, image) and paste into the following of the `test` branch of the `coolstore-config` repo
** ks.yaml -> kube/payment/deployment.yaml
** ksvc.yaml -> kube/payment/service.yaml

Instead, we will show a ready made branch that represents this checkin
====
+
. Go to the coolstore-gitops repo root and click on `Branches`
+
image:gitea-branches.png[]
+
. Click on `New Pull Request` next to the serverless branch
. Explain the differences as the infrastructure differences needed to fix the issue with knative

== Deploy New Info

. Open Pipelines
. Start a promote pipeline run that starts this time from the `serverless` branch
. Kick off the build and go back to the split view
. Wait for the new app to appear in argocd
. If all loads up, test out the cool store
. If it works, delete the app
. [red]#For the stake of the demo, set the `coolstore-argo` app to manual sync (for next section)#
. Go to gitea and get ready for the next section


== Promote to Staging

. Go to Pull Requests
. Look at the changes in the pull request
. Add a comment saying that this was tested and approved
. Merge the request
. Go back to split view (possibly making argocd bigger)
. Show the app differences now that it's out of sync
. Open the staging topology view
. Sync coolstore
. When done purchase something else
. Notice in the orders that the original order is still there (with our serverless message)

== Revert Commit

. Clone the gitea repo locally on your machine
. Use a tool like link:https://git-fork.com/[Fork] to visualize the setup
. Go to the last commit merged into master (if should be the ci-branch)
. Right-click and select `Revert`
+
image:fork-revert-commit.png[]
+
. This should create a checkin after master that looks like the previous one
. Push origin
** Enter gogs/gogs for user and password
. Switch back to the argocd window
. Refresh the coolstore-argo application, it should be out of sync
. Look at the Diff and notice that it's reverting back to `DeploymentConfig` etc.
. In the split view window to the left, show the Topology View once again of the `argocd-demo-stage` project
. Sync in ArgoCD and watch the infra change
. [red]#Pods should all be rebooted manually (set to 0 and back to 1) to make sure they have picked up the new topic info from the configmap#
. Open the Coolstore agin
. Purchase something new
. Go to the orders page and show the progression of purchases which all remained despite the changing infra
