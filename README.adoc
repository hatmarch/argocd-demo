== Introduction == 

This repo contains all the scripts and code (as submodules) needed to create a demo that supports this link:docs/Walkthrough.adoc[walkthrough] that demonstrates the basic functionality of argo:

* Deployment on merging of pull request
* Differential deployment using Kustomize

== Visual Studio Code Support ==

There is a `.devcontainer` in this repo so if you have VisualStudio Code with remote extensions enabled, you can open repo folder in a container that has all the tools necessary to run this demo already installed.

=== AWS Access (ROSA) ===

If you are using link:https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/containers/announcing-red-hat-openshift-service-on-aws/[ROSA] you can carry over your AWS credentials into the docker container has the devcontainer mounts your `~/.aws/` directory into the docker user (`jboss`) home directory.

If you'd like to setup a "virtual AWS environment" then do the following:

. Create a subdirectory of your `~/.aws/` directory where you would like your credentials to be stored
** e.g. `~/.aws/burner/rosa`
. On the host (and before running VSCode) set the `ARGODEMO_AWS_SUBDIRECTORY` environment varible to the relative path from the root `.aws` directory 
** e.g. `export ARGODEMO_AWS_SUBDIRECTORY="burner/rosa"` 

[TIP]
.ROSA cost control
====
In the devcontainer you can use the installed functions `rosa-up` and `rosa-down` to turn on or off (respectively) the underlying instances for the cluster in question.

If you don't want to provide a rosa cluster name, you can set the `ROSA_CLUSTER_NAME` environment variable on the host and this will be transfered to the container.  Equivalently, you can start VSCode like this (if your cluster name is `mwh-test`) from the root of the repo: 
----
ROSA_CLUSTER_NAME="mwh-test" code .
----

Bear in mind that you must be logged into `aws` cli and `rosa` to be able to fully execute these commands.  For instance, if you're not logged into `rosa` you'll likely see the following error.  You can get a login token using your Red Hat account link:https://console.redhat.com/openshift/token/rosa/show[here]

----
E: Failed to create OCM connection: Not logged in, run the 'rosa login' command
----
====

== Demo Setup ==

Run the link:scripts/create-demo.sh[create-demo.sh] script to setup all the necessary aspects of the demo.

Here is an example command with the `-i` option which will install all pre-requisites (e.g. operators)

----
$DEMO_HOME/scripts/create-demo.sh -i
----

== Demo Cleanup ==

To remove the demo, you can run the following command

----
$DEMO_HOME/scripts/cleanup.sh
----

If you want to uninstall all the supporting operators and CRDs, then you can run the cleanup command with the `-f` option

== Troubleshooting ==

=== ArgoCD ===

==== Command Line ====

To trigger a sync and get verbose output

----
argocd app sync coolstore-argo --loglevel debug    
----

To change details about an existing deployment use the `argocd app set` command

----
argocd app set coolstore-argo --directory-recurse=false     
----

=== MySQL ===

You can test access to a MySQL database in an OpenShift cluster using the `Adminer` image.

. First, setup port forwarding to the service in question (assuming a petclinic based service as shown in the walkthrough)
+
----
oc port-forward svc/petclinic-mysql 3306:3306
----
+
. Then, in another shell, run the `Adminer` image and have it port forward to 8080. _NOTE: Assumes you are running on a Mac using Docker for Mac, this is where the `docker.for.mac.localhost` stuff comes from_
+
----
docker run -p 8080:8080 -e ADMINER_DEFAULT_SERVER=docker.for.mac.localhost adminer:latest
----
+
. From the `Adminer` web page, login as root (using whatever secret was used in the setup of the cluster).  You can then run arbitrary commands.  Here are the commands you can run to grant access to a user pc to a newly created petclinic database (from link:https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-create-mysql-user-accounts-and-grant-privileges/[here])
+
----
CREATE USER 'pc'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'petclinic';
CREATE DATABASE petclinic;
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON petclinic.* TO 'pc'@'%';
----
+
.. Or instead, you run SQL commands from the local command line
+
----
oc run mysql-client --image=mysql:5.7 --restart=Never --rm=true --attach=true --wait=true \
    -- mysql -h petclinic-mysql -uroot -ppetclinic -e "CREATE USER 'pc'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'petclinic'; \
      CREATE DATABASE petclinic; \
      GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON petclinic.* TO 'pc'@'%';"
----

=== Troubleshooting Pipeline Tasks ===

==== General ====

If a pipeline fails and the logs are not enough to determine the problem, you can use the fact that every task maps to a pod to your advantage.

Let's say that the task "unit-test" failed in a recent run.

. First look for the pod that represents that run
+
----
$ oc get pods
NAME                                                              READY   STATUS      RESTARTS   AGE
petclinic-dev-pipeline-tomcat-dwjk4-checkout-vnp7v-pod-f8b5j      0/1     Completed   0          3m18s
petclinic-dev-pipeline-tomcat-dwjk4-unit-tests-5pct2-pod-4gk46    0/1     Error       0          3m
petclinic-dev-pipeline-tomcat-kpbx9-checkout-t78sr-pod-qnfrh      0/1     Error       0 
----
+
. Then use the `oc debug` command to restart that pod to look around:
+
----
$ oc debug po/petclinic-dev-pipeline-tomcat-dwjk4-unit-tests-5pct2-pod-4gk46
Starting pod/petclinic-dev-pipeline-tomcat-dwjk4-unit-tests-5pct2-pod-4gk46-debug, command was: /tekton/tools/entrypoint -wait_file /tekton/downward/ready -wait_file_content -post_file /tekton/tools/0 -termination_path /tekton/termination -entrypoint ./mvnw -- -Dmaven.repo.local=/workspace/source/artefacts -s /var/config/settings.xml package
If you don't see a command prompt, try pressing enter.

==== Volume Issues ====

Sometimes pipelines fail to run because the workspace volume cannot be mounted.  Looks like to root cause has to do with the underlying infra volume being deleted out from underneath a `PersistentVolume`.  If you have pipelines that are timing out due to pods failing to run (usually you won't get any log stream), take a look at the events on the pod and see if you notice these kind of mounting errors:

image:docs/images/missing-volume.png[]

This can usually be remedied by deleting the PVC, but finalizers keep PVCs from being deleted if a pod has a claim.

If you run into this issue, *cancel the affected pipeline* (otherwise the PVC won't be able to be deleted) and either run the following command or see the additional details that follow

----
scripts/util-recreate-pvc.sh pipeline-source-pvc.yaml
----

To see all the claims on a PVC, look for the `Mounted By` section of the output of the following describe command (for `pvc/maven-source-pvc`):
----
oc describe pvc/maven-source-pvc
----

To delete all pods that have a claim on the pvc `pvc/maven-source-pvc`:
----
oc delete pods $(oc describe pvc/maven-source-pvc | grep "Mounted By" -A40 | sed "s/ //ig" | sed "s/MountedBy://ig")
----

=== Troubleshooting OpenShift Permissions ===

You can use the `oc run` command to run certain containers in a given project as a service account.

For instance, this command can be used to see what kind of permissions the builder service account has to view other projects (e.g. access to remote imagestreams)

----
oc run test3 --image=quay.io/openshift/origin-cli:latest --serviceaccount=builder -it --rm=true
----

=== Troubleshooting (Local) Tomcat Server ===

If the tomcat extension fails to run, you can attempt the following:

. remote any old tomcat files
+
----
rm -f /opt/webserver/webse*
----
+
. Attempt to readd tomcat to /opt/webserver per the instructions above
+
. if that still doesn't work, rebuild container.
+
. If all else fails, [blue]#you can run the tomcat server locally#.  


=== OpenShift Nexus Installation ===

The `$DEMO_HOME/scripts/create-cicd.sh` will create a Nexus instance within the `petclinic-cicd` project and will configure the repo accordingly so that the application can be built appropriately.  Should something go wrong, this section outlines steps that the script should have undertaken so that you can troubleshoot.

image:images/nexus-maven-public.png[]

The original petclinic app uses some repos outside of maven central.  Namely:

* https://maven.repository.redhat.com/earlyaccess/all/
* https://repo.spring.io/milestone/

Here's how you would manually configure these in Nexus:

. Connect to the nexus instance (see route) 
+
----
echo "http://$(oc get route nexus -n petclinic-cicd -o jsonpath='{.spec.host}')/"
----
+
. Log into the nexus instance (standard nexus setup has admin, admin123)
+
. Go to _Repositories_ and _Create Repository_ for each of the repos needed
+
image:images/nexus-repositories.png[]
+
.. Here's example configuration for each of the above
+
image:images/nexus-spring-repo.png[Spring]
image:images/nexus-redhat.png[Red Hat]
+
. Add the two registries to the maven-public group as per the screenshot
+
[red]#FIXME: This is necessary until every build gets a semantic version number update#
+
. Update the `maven-releases` repo to allow updates like below:
+
image:images/nexus-repo-allow-redeploy.png[]

=== OpenShift Pipeline (Git) Triggers ===

Tekton allows for `EventListeners`, `TriggerTemplates`, and `TriggerBindings` to allow a git repo to hit a webhook and trigger a build.  See also link:https://github.com/tektoncd/triggers[here].  To get basic triggers going for both gogs and github run the following:

NOTE: For an example of triggers working with Tekton, see files link:https://github.com/siamaksade/tekton-cd-demo/tree/master/triggers[in the template directory of this repo]

NOTE: You may also want to consider link:https://github.com/tektoncd/experimental/blob/master/webhooks-extension/docs/GettingStarted.md[this tekton dashboard functionality]

YAML resources for the pipeline created for this demo can be found in these locations:

. Resources: $DEMO_HOME/kube/tekton/resources
. Triggers: $DEMO_HOME/kube/tekton/triggers

==== Triggered Pipeline Fails to Run ====

If the trigger doesn't appear to fire, then check the logs of the pod that is running that represents the webhook.  The probably is likely in the `PipelineRun` template.

==== Viewing (Extended) OpenShift Pipeline (Tekton) Logs ====

You can see limited logs in the Tekton UI, but if you want the full logs, you can access these from the command line using the `tkn` command

----
# Get the list of pipelineruns in the current project
tkn pipelinerun list

# Output the full logs of the named pipeline run (where petclinic-deploy-dev-run-j7ktj is a pipeline run name )
tkn pipelinerun logs petclinic-deploy-dev-run-j7ktj
----

To output the logs of a currently running pipelinerun (`pr`) and follow them, use:

----
tkn pr logs -L -f
----
